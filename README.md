# 👋 Hi, I'm Prudhvi Raj

🎓 MS in Computer Science @ Pace University (GPA: 3.7)  
🧠 Data Scientist · Machine Learning Engineer · Analyst  
🔍 I build production-ready ML systems, automate data workflows, and deliver clear insights from complex datasets.

---

## ⚡ What I Do

- Build supervised and time-series models for forecasting, churn, fraud, and pricing problems  
- Develop and deploy real-time data apps using Streamlit, Docker, and LLMs  
- Automate ETL pipelines, maintain data consistency, and deliver interactive dashboards  
- Integrate GenAI (LLMs) for contextual Q&A and insight generation

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Customer Churn & LTV Analytics Platform](https://github.com/Prudhvirajrekula/customer-churn-ltv-analytics-platform)
- Built a dual-model system combining LSTM (usage patterns) and Random Forest (demographics) to reach **91% churn accuracy**
- Automated ETL over 100K records and reduced latency by 50% using SQL and Python  
- Developed a **GenAI chatbot (“Muffin”)** using OpenRouter LLMs (Mistral, LLaMA, MythoMax) for natural language explanation of churn drivers  
- Dockerized for deployment on Streamlit Cloud and Hugging Face Spaces

### 🔹 [Real Estate Price Forecasting – Connecticut](https://github.com/Prudhvirajrekula/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Connecticut)
- Trained ensemble models (XGBoost, TensorFlow) on engineered locality, time, and lag features to achieve **R² = 0.82**
- Delivered a real-time Streamlit dashboard for interactive forecasting  
- Improved cross-region generalization with seasonal encodings and geographic segmentation

### 🔹 [EV Insights – Washington State](https://github.com/Prudhvirajrekula/EV-Insights-WA-Streamlit-App)
- Explored regional EV adoption using public datasets and classification models  
- Delivered insights via a real-time Streamlit dashboard with filterable location and trend visualizations

### 🔹 [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Prudhvirajrekula/Creditcard-Fraud-Detection-App)
- Used Random Forest + SMOTE + PCA on 284K transactions to detect fraud with **0.999 AUC**  
- Deployed an interactive Streamlit app for real-time scoring with clear user input handling

### 🔹 [U.S. Job Market Analysis (Tableau)](https://github.com/Prudhvirajrekula/USA-Job-Market-Analysis)
- Analyzed 10K+ job listings across industries and skill groups  
- Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore salary, demand, and experience trends
