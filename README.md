<h3 align="left">üë©‚Äçüíª  About Me</h3>

###

<p align="left">I am a Python full stack developer and computer science graduate student in my final semester at Pace University, actively seeking full-time roles and internships in full-stack development, software engineering, and cybersecurity. I am a dynamic and results-driven professional with hands-on experience across Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Data Analysis. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I have developed a diverse skill set that allows me to approach challenges from multiple angles and deliver innovative solutions.

In Cybersecurity, I have gained practical experience in threat detection, penetration testing, and vulnerability management, securing web applications and networks by applying best practices like OWASP and SIEM tools. I‚Äôve automated threat detection processes and conducted security audits, ensuring systems are resilient against emerging cyber threats.

As a Software Engineer, I specialize in full-stack development, leveraging my skills in React.js, Node.js, Python, and cloud technologies to design and optimize scalable, high-performance applications. I have successfully created RESTful APIs, deployed applications to AWS, and integrated front-end and back-end systems to provide seamless user experiences.

In Data Analysis, I excel at transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. Using tools like Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn), SQL, and data visualization platforms, I‚Äôve built predictive models, conducted exploratory data analysis, and visualized trends to support data-driven decision-making.

I am eager to leverage my multifaceted skill set in Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, and Data Analysis to drive innovation, solve real-world problems, and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations. Reach me at pr45629n@pace.edu.</p>
